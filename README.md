## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Martin 'Cozax' B. for his invaluable help and guidance, answering numerous questions about JavaScript during the development of this project.

## Known Issues

Currently, there is one known issue/limitation in the project: due to a deprecated part of the API, retrieving recommended items for champions may result in longer loading times, especially for champions with recommendations spanning multiple patches. This issue causes delays of about fifteen seconds while the code loops through past patches to find the specified items for the selected champion.
